We again introduced several changes that are scheduled for version 0.5.0 and can be activated using `pragma experimental "v0.5.0";`. In this release, this pragma does not generate a warning anymore, so you can (and should) use it in production code.

In addition to that, you can now specify which EVM version the contract should be compiled for. Valid values are "homestead", "tangerineWhistle", "spuriousDragon", "byzantium" (the default) and "constantinople". Depending on this setting, different opcodes will be used in some cases. The only place where this is currently used by default is that all gas is forwarded with calls starting from "tangerineWhistle" (in homestead, some gas has to be retained for the ``call`` opcode itself). Also, the gas estimator reports different costs for the opcodes depending on the version and thus the optimizer might generate different code.

The new "0.5.0" features are explained in more detail below the list of features and bugfixes.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
